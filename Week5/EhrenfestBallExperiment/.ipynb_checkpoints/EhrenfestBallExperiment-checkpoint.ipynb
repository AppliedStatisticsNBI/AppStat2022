    "\n",
    "2) Rewrite the system so at each turn there is a 50% chance of nothing happens (ie no ball is moved). How does this affect the probabilities? Can all states be reached after 20 turns?\n",

    "3) Change the number of turns to something much larger (try 1000). What value is the most probable to reach? Does this make sense?\n",

    "\n",
    "4) Assume that the state #10 (where all balls are blue) is an absorbing state, so nothing changes after this state is reached. What is the average number of turns to reach this? Can you find a PDF that fits the distribution of first passage times?\n",
    "\n",
