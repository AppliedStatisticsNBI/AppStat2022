    "\n",
    "This exercise is about more advanced fitting of data. The idea is to begin with the simplest possible function that even remotely does the job, which is then expanded to accommodate all the features present in the data fitted. The data is from three versions of a damped harmonic oscillator, consisting of a weight hanging from a spring, but with different damping:\n",
    "- No additional damping.\n",
    "- More damping from a round piece of cardboard, which increases the drag.\n",
    "- Damping from friction of the weight against metal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your task\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the various dataset, and try to fit them with an appropriate function. By considering patterns in the fit residuals, one can get an idea of what to further include. Play around with the initial parameters of the fits and the various possible additions to the function. Answer / Discuss the questions written at the bottom of this notebook. Remember to try to fit all three datasets.\n",

    "   small part of the curve (say xy: [0.1,0.3] x [-0.6,0.4]) in a large (e.g. 15x20) plot,\n",
    "   where it should be possible to fit it with a line (even by eye).\n",
    "   Since you know that for a small enough range of the data, this will be a reasonable\n",
    "   PDF to use, you can extract the error from the Std. of the residuals, which gives you\n",
    "   a rough estimate of the errors on the points (remember the pendulum timing!).\n",
    "   Compare the error you got to the one I put in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you have tried, set the error to 0.0037, and try to fit a damped harmonic oscillator.\n",

    "           - - - - - -     5-10 minutes (success or failure) later - - - - - -\n",

    "   need to set the initial parameters quite accurately, for the fit to work. Think about\n",
